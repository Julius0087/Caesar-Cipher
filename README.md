# Caesar-Cipher
A ruby script for the Caesar Cipher assignment from The Odin Project

The repository contains two files - the second (caesar_cipher_2.rb) is experimental and does not work.
The first one contains a method to convert a string into its encrypted variant using the Caesar cipher.
Pass the string and the key (number of letters the cipher will shift the original letters) into the method.
